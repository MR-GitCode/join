                                <a href="./index.html">Join</a> is a kanban-based project
                                management tool designed and built by a group of dedicated students as
                                part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
                            </p>

                                Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective
                                method to visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
                                efficiency (or flow). <a href="./index.html">Join</a> leverages
                                the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects
                                in an intuitive, visual interface.

                            <table>
                                <tr>

                                        <p>
                                            When you log in to <a href="./index.html">Join</a>, you'll
                                            find a default board. This board represents your project and
                                            contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await
                                            feedback” and "Done".

                                        <p>
                                            In <a href="./index.html">Join</a>, you can add contacts to
                                            collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section,
                                            click on "New contact", and fill in the required information.
                                            Once added, these contacts can be assigned tasks and they can
                                            interact with the tasks on the board.
                                        </p>
                                    </td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td class="number">3.</td>

                                        <p>
                                            Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
                                            Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
                                            appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details
                                            in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees,
                                            etc.
                                        </p>
                                    </td>

                                        <p>
                                            As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect
                                            that on the board by dragging and dropping the card from one
                                            list to another.
                                        </p>
                                    </td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td class="number">5.</td>
                                    <td>
                                        <h4>Deleting Cards</h4>
                                        <p>
                                            Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done"
                                            list or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it
                                            from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as
                                            this action is irreversible.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Remember that using <a href="./index.html">Join</a> effectively
                                            requires consistent updates from you and your team to ensure the board
                                            reflects the current state of your project.
                                        </p>
